\begin{abstract}
  One of the major bottlenecks in the development of data-driven AI Systems is the lack of reliable human annotations. The recent advent of several crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk, allowing requesters the access to affordable and rapid results of a global workforce, greatly facilitates the creation of massive training data. Most of the available studies on the effectiveness of crowdsourcing report on English data. We use Mechanical Turk annotations to train an Opinion Mining System to classify Spanish consumer comments. We design three different Human Intelligence Task (HIT) strategies and show high inter-annotator agreement between non-experts and expert annotators. We evaluate the advantages/drawbacks of each HIT design and report \texttt{<results of the classifier>}.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:intro}

The recent advent of crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk\footnote{\texttt{https://www.mturk.com}}, Crowdflower\footnote{\texttt{http://crowdflower.com/}} and others has attracted a lot of attention both from companies as from academia. Crowdsourcing enables requesters to tap from a global pool of non-experts to obtain rapid and affordable answers to simple Human Intelligence Tasks (HITs), which can be subsequently used to train data-driven AI systems.

A number of recent papers on this subject point out that non-expert annotations, if produced in a sufficient quantity, can rival and even surpass the quality of expert annotations, often at a much lesser cost \cite{snow_cheap_2008}, \cite{su_internet-scale_2007}. However, this possible increase in quality depends on the task at hand and on an adequate HIT design \cite{kittur_crowdsourcing_2008}.

In this paper, we evaluate the usefulness of AMT annotations to train an Opinion Mining system to detect opinionated contents (Polarity Detection) in Spanish customer comments on car brands. Currently, a large majority of AMT tasks is designed for English speakers. One of the reasons for participating in this shared task was to find out how easy it is to obtain annotated data for Spanish. In addition, we want to find out how useful these data are, by comparing them to expert annotations and using them to train an Opinion Mining system for polarity detection.

This paper is structured as follows. Section \ref{sect:outline} contains an explanation of the task outline and our goals. Section \ref{sect:design} contains an analysis of three different HIT designs that we used in this task. In Section \ref{sect:results}, we provide a detailed analysis of the retrieved HITs and focus on geographical information of the workers, the correlation between the different HIT designs, the quality of the retrieved answers and the total cost of the experiment. In Section \ref{sect:classifier}, we evaluate the incidence of AMT-generated annotations on a polarity classification task using two different experimental settings. Finally, we conclude in Section \ref{sect:conclusions}.

\section{Task Outline and Goals}
\label{sect:outline}

We compare different HIT design strategies by evaluating the usefulness of resulting Mechanical Turk (AMT) annotations to train an Opinion Mining System on Spanish consumer data. More specifically, we address the following research questions:\\
 \indent (i) Annotation quality: how do the different AMT annotations compare to expert annotations? We compare the inter-annotator agreement in expert annotations with the inter-annotator agreement in the different AMT annotations.\\
 \indent (ii) Annotation applicability: how does the performance of an Opinion Mining classifier vary after training on different (sub)sets of AMT and expert annotations? Given a simple classification technique, we evaluate the system performance by using AMT annotations, expert annotations and the combination of both as training data. The idea is not to evaluate the classification technique \textit{per se}, but to measure the influence of the training material.\\
 \indent (iii) Return on Investment (ROI): how does the use of AMT annotations compare economically against the use of expert annotations? AMT offers the possibility of obtaining inexpensive annotations the quality of which tends to be worse than expert annotations \texttt{<include ref>}. We show that, for the task at hand, the ROI is positive.\\
 \indent (iv) Language barriers: \texttt{x\%} of all AMT tasks are designed for English speakers \texttt{<include ref>}. How easy is it to get reliable AMT results for Spanish? 

\section{HIT Design}
\label{sect:design}

We selected a dataset of 1000 sentences containing user opinions on cars from the automotive section of \texttt{www.ciao.es} (Spanish). This website was chosen because it contains a large and varied pool of Spanish customer comments suitable to train an Opinion Mining System and because opinions include simultaneously global numeric and specific ratings over particular attributes of the subject matter. Section \ref{datasets} contains more detailed information about the selection of the dataset. An example of a sentence from the data set can be found in (\ref{ex}):

\begin{li}
  \label{ex}
  `No te lo pienses m\'{a}s, c\'{o}mpratelo!'\\
  ($=$ `Don't think twice, buy it!')
\end{li}

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \fbox{
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]
	{pics/Reshots_All.png}}
	\caption{An example sentence (a) and the three HIT designs used in the experiments: (b) HIT1: a simple categorization scheme, (c) HIT2: a graded categorization scheme, and (d) HIT3: a continuous triangular categorization scheme containing both a horizontal positive-negative axis and a vertical subjective-objective axis.}
	\label{hits}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The sentences in the dataset were presented to the AMT workers in three different HIT designs. Each HIT design contains a single sentence to be evaluated. HIT1 is a simple categorization scheme in which workers are asked to classify the sentence as being either \textit{positive}, \textit{negative} or \textit{neutral}, as is shown in Figure \ref{hits}, section b. HIT2 is a graded categorization template in which workers had to assign a score between -5 (negative) and +5 (positive) to the example sentence, as is shown in Figure \ref{hits}, section c. Finally, HIT3 is a continuous triangular categorization template that allows workers to use both a horizontal positive-negative axis and a vertical subjective-objective axis by placing the example sentence anywhere inside the triangle. The subjective-objective axis expresses the degree to which the sentence contains opinionated content and was earlier used by \cite{sentiwordnet:06}. For example, the sentence \textit{`I think this is a wonderful car'} clearly marks an opinion and should be positioned towards the subjective end, while the sentence \textit{`The car has six cilinders'} should be located towards the objective end. Figure \ref{hits}, section d contains an example of HIT3. In order not to burden the workers with overly complex instructions, we did not mention this subjective-objective axis but asked them instead to place ambiguous sentences towards the center of the horizontal positive-negative axis and more objective, non-opinionated sentences towards the lower \textit{neutral} tip of the triangle.

For each of the three HIT designs, we specified the requirement of three different unique assignments per HIT, which led to a total amount of $3 \times 3 \times 1000 = 9000$ HITs being uploaded on AMT. Mind that setting the requirement of unique assigments ensures a number of unique workers \textit{per individual HIT}, but does not ensure a consistency of workers over a single batch of 1000 HITs. This is in the line with the philosophy of crowdsourcing, which allows many different people to participate in the same task.

\section{Annotation Task Results and Analysis}
\label{sect:results}

After designing the HITs, we uploaded 30 random samples for testing purposes. These HITs were completed in a matter of seconds, mostly by workers in India. After a brief inspection of the results, it was obvious that most answers corresponded to random clicks. Therefore, we decided to include a small competence test to ensure that future workers would possess the necessary linguistic skills to perform the task. The test consists of six simple categorisation questions of the type of HIT1 that a skilled worker would be able to perform in under a minute. In order to discourage the use of automatic translation tools, a time limit of two minutes was  imposed and test sentences contain idiomatic constructions notoriously difficult for Machine Translation Systems.

\subsection{HIT Statistics}

Table \ref{table.stats} contains statistics on the workers who completed our HITs. A total of 19 workers passed the competence test and submitted at least one HIT. Of those, four workers completed HITs belonging to two different designs and six submitted HITs in all three designs. Twelve workers are located in the US (64\%), three in Spain (16\%), and one in Mexico (5\%), Equador (5\%), The Netherlands (5\%) and an unknown location (5\%).

As to a comparison of completion times, it took a worker on average 11 seconds to complete an instance of HIT1, and 9 seconds to complete an instance of HIT2 and HIT3. At first sight, this result might seem surprising, since conceptually there is an increase in complexity when moving from HIT1 to HIT2 and from HIT2 to HIT3. These results might suggest that users find it easier to classify items on a graded or continuous scale such as HIT2 and HIT3, which allows for a certain degree of flexibility, than on a stricter categorical template such as HIT1, where there is no room for error.

\subsection{Annotation Distributions}

\subsection{Annotation Quality}
\label{sect:quality}

The annotation quality of AMT workers can be measured by comparing them to expert annotations. This is usually done by calculating inter-annotator agreement (ITA) scores. Note that, since a single HIT can contain more than one assignment and each assignment is typically performed by more than one annotator, we can only calculate ITA scores between batches of assignments, rather than between individual workers. Therefore, we describe the ITA scores in terms of batches. In Table \ref{table.ita}, we present a comparison of standard kappa\footnote{In reality, we found that fixed and free margin Kappa values were almost identical, which reflects the balanced distribution of the dataset.} calculations \cite{eugenio_kappa_2004} between batches of assignments in HIT1 and expert annotations.

We found an inter-batch ITA score of 0.598, which indicates a moderate agreement due to fairly consistent annotations between workers. When comparing individual batches with expert annotations, we found similar ITA scores, in the range between 0.628 and 0.649. This increase with respect to the inter-batch score suggests a higher variability among AMT workers than between workers and experts. 
In order to filter out noise in worker annotations, we applied a simple majority voting procedure in which we selected, for each sentence in HIT1, the most voted category. This results in an additional batch of annotations. This batch, refered in Table \ref{table.ita} as \textit{Majority}, produced a considerably higher ITA score of 0.716, which confirms the validity of the majority voting scheme to obtain better annotations.

In addition, we calculated ITA scores between three expert annotators on a separate, 500-sentence dataset, randomly selected from the same corpus as described at the start of Section \ref{sect:design}. This collection was later used as test set in the experiments described in Section \ref{sect:classifier}. The inter-expert ITA scores on this separate dataset contains values of 0.725 for $\kappa_{1}$ and 0.729 for $\kappa_{2}$, only marginally higher than the \textit{Majority} ITA scores. Although we are comparing results on different data sets, these results seem to indicate that multiple AMT annotations are able to produce a similar quality to expert annotations. This might suggest that a further increase in the number of HIT assignments would outperform expert ITA scores, as was previously reported in~\cite{snow_cheap_2008}.

\subsection{Annotation Cost}

\texttt{<This is another useful reference: \cite{mason_financial_2009}>}

At the specified cost of 0.02\$ per HIT, a total sum of 180\$ (minus Amazon fees) was spent on the task.

In order to decide to use the Amazon's "mechanical turk" it's important to measure the quality of the results, but, of course, the cost of performing the annotation using turkers instead of in-house experts and the time needed to perform the annotation must also be taken into account.
To compute the in-House costs, the expert or engineer is paid at a rate of 70\$ an hour, including salary and all other structural costs. The in-house annotation tasks of 1000 sentences would last for three hours, giving a cost of 210\$ and a marginal cost of preparing the data. By means of Amazon we spent 75\$ to annotate the same sentences three times, to get the same quality of results. But we must add the costs of designing the Hits and  the qualifying test and the task of upload the data into Amazon's servers. These tasks highly depend on the experience of the engineers developing it, and can range from a couple of hours to a couple of days (for the first times).
As the volume of data to annotate increases, the economical benefit of the AMT is more evident, because the design time becomes a small portion of the budget. For annotating 30,000 sentences the differences rises up to 1350\$ that are more than enough to design the hit. 
But the main important economic impact may not be the cost but the time to perform the task. In-house massive annotation may take a lot of time, and can become a hard task, as a few users need to annotate a lot of sentences. As this task can become tiresome and hard it needs to be elapsed in time. In AMT the a hit may be distributed into many volunteers that 24 hours a day are ready to work in parallel to produce the results in a few hours.     

% It's interesting that the inter annotation agreement between the agregated majority batch and the Expert was almost the same than the inter annotation agreement of the experts*.

\section{Incidence of annotations on supervised polarity classification}
\label{sect:classifier}

This section intends to evaluate the incidence of AMT-generated annotations on a polarity classification task. We present two different evaluations. In the evaluation of Section \ref{eval1}, we compare the results of training a polarity classification system with noisy available metadata and with AMT generated annotations of HIT1. In the evaluation of Section \ref{eval2}, we compare the results of training several polarity classifiers on six different training sets, each of them generated from the AMT annotations of HIT1.

\subsection{Experiment one: AMT annotations vs. original Ciao annotations}
\label{eval1}

In this section, a comparative evaluation between two polarity classification systems is conducted. More specifically, baseline or reference classifiers trained with noisy available metadata are compared with contrastive classifiers trained with AMT generated annotations. Although more sophisticated classification schemas can be conceived for this task, a simple SVM-based binary supervised classification approach is considered here.

\subsubsection{Description of datasets}
\label{datasets}

As was mentioned in Section \ref{sect:design}, all sentences were extracted from a corpus of user opinions on cars from the automotive section of \texttt{www.ciao.es} (Spanish). For conducting the experimental evaluation, three different datasets were considered:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Baseline: constitutes the dataset used for training the baseline or reference classifiers. 
Automatic annotation for this dataset was obtained by using the following naive approach: those sentences extracted from
comments with ratings\footnote{The corpus at \texttt{www.ciao.es} contains consumer opinions marked with a score between 1 (negative) and 5 (positive). \texttt{<Rafael, please correct.>}} equal to 5 were assigned to category `positive', those extracted from comments with ratings 
equal to 3 were assigned to `neutral', and those extracted from comments with ratings equal to 1 were assigned to
`negative'. This dataset contains a total of 5570 sentences, with a vocabulary coverage of 11797 words. 

\item Annotated: constitutes the dataset that was manually annotated by AMT workers in HIT1.
This dataset is used for training the contrastive classifiers which are to be compared with baseline system.
The three independent annotations generated by AMT workers for each sentence within this dataset were consolidated into one unique annotation
by majority voting: if the three provided annotations happened to be
different\footnote{This kind of total disagreement among annotators occurred only in 13 sentences out of 1000.}, 
the sentence was assigned to category `neutral'; otherwise, the sentence was assigned to the category with
at least two annotation agreements. This dataset contains a total of 1000 sentences, with a vocabulary coverage 
of 3022 words. 

\item Evaluation: constitutes the gold standard used for evaluating the performance of classifiers.
This dataset was manually annotated by three experts in an independent manner. The gold standard annotation
was consolidated by using the same criterion used in the case of the previous dataset\footnote{In this case, 
annotator inter-agreement was above 80\%, and total disagreement among annotators occurred only in 1 sentence
out of 500}. This dataset contains a total of 500 sentences, with a vocabulary coverage of 2004 words.    
\end{enumerate} 

These three datasets were constructed by randomly extracting sample sentences from an original corpus
of over 25000 user comments containing more than 1000000 sentences in total. The sampling was conducted 
with the following constraints in mind: (i) the three resulting datasets should not overlap, (ii) only sentences 
containing more than 3 tokens are considered, and (iii) each resulting dataset must be balanced, as much
as possible, in terms of the amount of sentences per category. Table \ref{tc_corpus} presents the
distribution of sentences per category for each of the three considered datasets.  

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
&Baseline &Annotated &Evaluation \\

Totals &5570 &1000 &500 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Sentence-per-category distributions for baseline, annotated and evaluation datasets.}
\label{tc_corpus}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Experimental settings}
As mentioned above, a simple SVM-based supervised classification approach was considered for the
polarity detection task under consideration. According to this, two different groups of classifiers were 
considered: a baseline or reference group, and a contrastive group. Classifiers within these two groups were
trained with data samples extracted from the baseline and annotated datasets, respectively. Within each group 
of classifiers, three different binary classification subtasks were considered: positive/not\_positive, 
negative/not\_negative and neutral/not-neutral. All trained binary classifiers were evaluated by computing 
precision and recall for each considered category, as well as overall classification accuracy, over the 
evaluation dataset.

A feature space model representation of the data was constructed by considering the standard bag-of-words approach. 
In this way, a sparse vector was obtained for each sentence in the datasets. Stop-word removal was not
conducted before computing vector models, and standard normalization and TF-IDF weighting schemes were used.

Multiple-fold cross-validation was used in all conducted experiments to tackle with statistical variability of the 
data. In this sense, twenty independent realizations were actually conducted for each experiment presented and,
instead of individual output results, mean values and standard deviations of evaluation metrics are reported.

Each binary classifier realization was trained with a random subsample set of 600 sentences extracted from 
the training dataset corresponding to the classifier group, i.e. baseline dataset for reference systems, 
and annotated dataset for contrastive systems. Training subsample sets were always balanced with respect to 
the original three categories: `positive', `negative' and `neutral'.

\subsubsection{Results and discussion}
Table \ref{tc_pre_rec} presents the resulting mean values of precision and recall for each considered category 
in classifiers trained with either the baseline or the annotated dataset. As observed in the table, with the
exception of recall for category `negative' and precision for category `not\_negative', both metrics are substantially 
improved when the annotated dataset is used for training the classifiers. The most impressive improvements
are observed for `neutral' precision and recall. 

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
class &precision &recall \\

\end{tabular}
\caption{Mean precision and recall over 20 independent simulations (with standard deviations provided in parenthesis) 
for each considered class in classifiers trained with either the baseline dataset (upper values) or the annotated dataset (lower values).}
\label{tc_pre_rec}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tc_accu} presents the resulting mean values of accuracy for each considered subtask 
in classifiers trained with either the baseline or the annotated dataset. As observed in the table,
all subtasks benefit from using the annotated dataset for training the classifiers; however, it is 
important to mention that while similar absolute gains are observed for the `positive/not\_positive' 
and `neutral/not\_neutral' subtasks, this is not the case for the subtask `negative/not\_negative', 
which actually gains much less than the other two subtasks.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
classifier &baseline &annotated \\ 
\hline
positive/not\_positive &59.63 (3.04) &69.53 (1.70) \\ 
\hline
negative/not\_negative &60.09 (2.90) &63.73 (1.60) \\ 
\hline
neutral/not\_neutral &51.27 (2.49) &62.57 (2.08) \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Mean accuracy over 20 independent simulations (with standard deviations provided in parenthesis) 
for each classification subtasks trained with either the baseline or the annotated dataset.}
\label{tc_accu}
\end{table}

After considering all evaluation metrics, the benefit provided by human-annotated data 
availability for categories `neutral' and `positive' is evident. However, in the case of category `negative', although some 
gain is also observed, the benefit of human-annotated data does not seem to be as much as for the two other 
categories. This, along with the fact that the `negative/not\_negative' subtask is actually the best performing
one (in terms of accuracy) when baseline training data is used, might suggest that low rating comments contains 
a better representation of sentences belonging to category `negative' than medium and high rating comments do with
respect to classes `neutral' and `positive'. 

In any case, this experimental work only verifies the feasibility of constructing training datasets for
opinionated content analysis, as well as it provides an approximated idea of costs involved in the generation
of this type of resources, by using AMT.


\subsection{Experiment two: AMT annotations vs. expert annotations}
\label{eval2}

In this section, we compare the results of training several polarity classifiers on six different training sets, each of them generated from the AMT annotations of HIT1. The different training sets are: (i) the original dataset of 1000 sentences annotated by experts (\textit{Experts}), (ii) the first set of 1000 AMT results (\textit{Batch1}), (iii) the second set of 1000 AMT results (\textit{Batch2}), (iv) the third set of 1000 AMT results (\textit{Batch3}), (v) the batch obtained by majority voting between Batch1, Batch2 and Batch3 (\textit{Majority}), and (vi) a batch of 3000 training instances obtained by aggregating Batch1, Batch2 and Batch3 (\textit{All}). In \cite{mccallum}, 

Table \ref{table:amtvsexp} contains results of four different classifiers (Maxent, C45, Winnow and SVM), trained on these six different datasets and evaluated on the same 500-sentence test set as explained in Section \ref{datasets}. The Maxent classifier ... The C45 decision tree ... The Winnow classifier. Finally, the SVM ...

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sect:conclusions}
In this paper we have analyzed the use of Amazon's "mechanical turk" to annotate polarity of sentences. We have observed that even that the quality of single annotators may be lower than using experts, the price of each annotation is so cheap that allows the use of multiple annotators to reach similar quality still at lower prices. 
From the different designs of the hits that we did, we can conclude that the complexity of the task was simpler than we thought, (and maybe two cents was a high price) and that what a priory seemed simpler the turkers took more time than the multiple answers task that includes richest data. From a first trial Hit we observed some users answering at random, also the task was in Spanish, and somehow we had to be sure that the turkers would understand the language. We designed a qualifying test (from which we don't have any information about how many users tried it and failed, we think that could be interesting to have this information). 

  

\texttt{Future work: HIT Design: what is the optimal design of the annotation task for our purpose and what is the effect of a suboptimal design on the system scores? We present AMT workers with three different HIT designs and evaluate the impact of each of them on the overall system performance. Train classifiers with results from HIT2/HIT3. two ways of measuring quality: kappa \& performance}
